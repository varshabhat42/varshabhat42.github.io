Hello! I'm **Varsha Bhat**, a passionate Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience building scalable backend systems and cloud infrastructure.

- **Full-Stack Development** - From React frontends to Java/Python backends
- **Automation & DevOps** - Creating CI/CD pipelines and automating manual workflows

### Currently:
